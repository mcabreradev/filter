# Husky Setup Guide

## ✅ Installation Complete

Husky has been successfully configured for this project with pre-commit and pre-push hooks.

## 📋 What Was Installed

- **husky** (v9.1.7) - Git hooks management
- **lint-staged** (v16.2.4) - Run linters on staged files

## 🔧 Configuration

### Pre-commit Hook
**Location:** `.husky/pre-commit`

**What it does:**
1. Runs `lint-staged` on staged TypeScript files (auto-fix + format)
2. Runs full TypeScript type checking
3. Prevents commit if checks fail

**Execution time:** ~2-5 seconds

### Pre-push Hook
**Location:** `.husky/pre-push`

**What it does:**
1. Runs complete test suite (`pnpm run test`)
2. Runs TypeScript type checking
3. Runs ESLint on all source files
4. Prevents push if any check fails

**Execution time:** ~10-30 seconds

## 📝 Package.json Changes

Added/Modified scripts:
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "lint:fix": "eslint src/**/*.ts --fix",
    "prepare": "husky || true"
  },
  "lint-staged": {
    "*.ts": [
      "eslint --fix",
      "prettier --write"
    ]
  }
}
```

## 🚀 How It Works

### On Commit
```bash
git add src/some-file.ts
git commit -m "feat: add new feature"
```

Husky will automatically:
- ✅ Lint and format your staged `.ts` files
- ✅ Run type checking across the project
- ✅ Allow commit if all checks pass
- ❌ Block commit if any check fails

### On Push
```bash
git push origin your-branch
```

Husky will automatically:
- ✅ Run all tests
- ✅ Type check the entire codebase
- ✅ Lint all source files
- ✅ Allow push if everything passes
- ❌ Block push if any check fails

## 🔓 Bypassing Hooks (Emergency Only)

If you absolutely need to skip the hooks:

```bash
# Skip pre-commit hook
git commit --no-verify -m "emergency fix"

# Skip pre-push hook
git push --no-verify
```

⚠️ **Warning:** Only use `--no-verify` in genuine emergencies. The hooks are there to protect code quality.

## 🧪 Testing the Setup

### Test pre-commit hook:
```bash
# Make a change to a TypeScript file
echo "// test" >> src/index.ts

# Stage and commit
git add src/index.ts
git commit -m "test: husky pre-commit"

# You should see:
# 🔍 Running pre-commit checks...
# 📝 Type checking...
# ✅ Pre-commit checks passed!
```

### Test pre-push hook:
```bash
# Try to push
git push

# You should see:
# 🧪 Running pre-push checks...
# 🧪 Running tests...
# 📝 Type checking...
# 🔍 Linting all files...
# ✅ Pre-push checks passed! Ready to push.
```

## 📊 Current Status

- ✅ Husky installed and initialized
- ✅ Pre-commit hook configured
- ✅ Pre-push hook configured
- ✅ Hooks are executable
- ✅ lint-staged configured
- ✅ All commands tested successfully

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting

### Hooks not running?
```bash
# Reinstall husky hooks
pnpm exec husky install
```

### Permission issues?
```bash
# Make hooks executable
chmod +x .husky/pre-commit .husky/pre-push
```

### Want to modify hooks?
Edit the files directly:
- `.husky/pre-commit`
- `.husky/pre-push`
